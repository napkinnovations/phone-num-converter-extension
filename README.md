# phone-num-converter-extension
An extension that will help me quickly convert phone numbers in a (XXX)-XXX-XXXX format into an all-integer format. Supposed to be very simple, and it will be a good refresher on how to use CSS frameworks (Bulma), how to use HTML and JS together without React or Node.js, and building the confidence to create web extensions. 
This extension is not free to the public as I have not published this on Google Chrome's extension store. This is entirely for personal use.
